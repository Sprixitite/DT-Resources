# Topic 4 Â· UI & Data Compression ðŸ’¿

### UI Interfaces

**WIMP â†’** WIMP is an interface style from the 1980s that uses a graphical user interface (GUI) with elements like **windows, menus, icons, and pointers**. *It allows users to interact with their computer in an easy and intuitive manner.*

> > **Windows â†’** The active area on the screen is used to display activity such as processing within a program, files and folders. It can be scrolled, minimised, maximised, opened, and closed, and more than one window can be opened at the same time.

> > **Icons â†’** Small pictures or symbols displayed on the screen are easily understood and act as a shortcut to a program, folder or file. By simply clicking on them with the mouse and pointer, you can then select the target object. To start the application or activity, all you need to do is double click.

> > **Menus â†’** Used to group related options/actions together, providing a list of choices from which the user can select using a pointer and mouse. Menus can include pop-up, pull-down, and sub-menus.

> > **Pointer â†’** An icon on the screen which moves in response to the movement of a mouse is a convenient way to navigate and select items. It can also change shape depending on its position, and further action can be initiated with a right or double click.

**CLI â†’** A powerful and quicker way for a user to interact with a computer by typing commands at a prompt. Requires knowledge of the computer's operations and command line interpreter.

**Forms Dialogue â†’** Interface presents a sequence of forms with text boxes, list boxes/radio buttons for user selections, control buttons for navigating and validations/verifications. Forms also include response fields, prompts, and error messages.

### Data Compression

Data compression r**educes the file size of a file** and **reduces the time taken to transmit it** over a network. It uses a series of algorithms to reduce the amount of space taken up by data on a storage medium.

| **Benefits of Data Compression**            | **Drawbacks of Data Compression**            |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Reduced file size                           | Increased processing time.                   |
| Reduced time to send as an email attachment | Quality is lost if lossy compression is used |
| Less bandwidth to send file over internet   | Not compatible with all file formats         |

### Zipping

Zipping is the process of compressing data files using the LZW algorithm. This looks for repeating patterns in the data being compressed and replaces these with a single character. This reduces the storage or memory taken up by a file.

**Here are some common file formats â¬‡**

**TXT â†’** Can be read by all word processors and operating systems, all formatting is removed, small file size, cannot contain objects such as images or structures such as tables.

**WAV â†’** Used for professional recording and editing, generally uncompressed, uses a process known as sampling to store a digital representation of a recorded analogue sound signal.

**BMP â†’** Method of creating images where a picture is held as a pattern of bits, can appear jagged/pixelated when scaled, good method of reproducing graduated areas of tone.

**JPEG â†’** Standard image compression format, file size is reduced, JPEG is â€˜lossyâ€™, with the degree of â€˜lossinessâ€™ being adjustable.

**GIF â†’** Method of compressing colour or grey-scale images, lossless format, 8-bit format, used for simple animations.

**MPEG â†’** Used for moving images, uses a compression known as delta compression, full picture is sent only occasionally, information containing only changes is transmitted which uses less data.
